# CENG111-THE2-Tester
# Tester for the CENG111 Take Home Exam 2 in 2020-21 Fall Semester.

This tester is for the second Take Home Exam of CENG 111 course.
To use this tester:
    Cut and paste your DATA = get_data() line into the function new_move as an argument.
    	 for example, def new_move(DATA=get_data()):
    Import our tester_evaluator on your THE2.py file.
    And run 

Do not:
	Touch to DONOTTOUCH.txt unless any unexpected error occurs. That file should always contain a single 0 in it.
	Terminate tester.py's process. Always wait for it to complete its job, albeit it may take some time.
	Forget to put DATA = get_data() to its right place back after your work with tester is done. 

Tester prints failed cases, expected results and your code's answers to false_cases.txt. You can copy and paste them to evaluator.py
which came in THE2 folder and better observe your code's behaviour better.

Expected results are calculated with respects to our outputs. If you think they are incorrect, please contact us and share your output.
