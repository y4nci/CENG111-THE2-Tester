# CENG111-THE2-Tester
# Tester for the CENG111 Take Home Exam 2 in 2020-21 Fall Semester.

This tester is for the second Take Home Exam of CENG 111 course.

To use this tester:

    Put the2.py and these files in the same directory.
    Cut and paste your DATA = get_data() line into the function new_move as an argument.
    	 for example; def new_move(DATA=get_data()):
    Import our tester_evaluator on your THE2.py file instead of original evaluator.
    And run!

Do not:

	Touch to DONOTTOUCH.txt. That file should always contain a single 0 in it.
	Terminate tester.py's process. Always wait for it to complete its job, albeit it may take some time.
	Forget to put DATA = get_data() to its right place back after your work with tester is done. 

In case of errors or getting unexpected FALSE results, first control DONOTTOUCH.txt. If it contains exactly one 0 as it should,
try to run the code once again. If you get the error or the results you think you shouldn't be getting, contact us.

Tester prints failed cases, expected results to false_cases.txt. You can copy and paste them to evaluator.py
which came in the original THE2 folder and better observe your code's behaviour.

Expected results are calculated with respect to our outputs. If you think they are incorrect, please contact us and share your output.
